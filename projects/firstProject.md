## Why this post exists

There’s a photo from study abroad where my roommate **Rei** shows up. Seeing it reminded me how much a *good environment* pushes me forward.  
So this “first project” post is now about swimming: where I started, what changed, and what I’m trying next.

## The quick timeline (50 m freestyle)

- **2022-07-11** — 36.96

- **2023-03-06** — **28.91**  
  ↳ clip: <https://youtu.be/q6Pg6k7ORuM?si=SzW1yQzWrZFKCZ7l>

That was an **8.05 s** drop (about **21.8%** faster). Then I drifted away from swimming for a while.

## Why I’m back now

I’ve got access to facilities that make it easy to *just go*:

- **WRC** – a place I naturally want to move my body  
- **Duke Complex** – lanes, clocks, and everything that removes excuses

The goal is simple: **beat my previous best**, enjoy the process, and see what consistent, friendly training does. No drama—just reps.

## Small plan, big consistency

- **2–3 swims/week**, short sessions are fine  
- **Technique first**: easy drills, relaxed breathing, clean turns  
- **Light log**: time, RPE, and one thing that felt better

I’ll keep it playful—like mini side quests. If I PB, great. If not, I still get a stronger, calmer body out of it.
